## 🛠️ Built With Love & Coffee

```bash
# The usual suspects
Next.js 15 + React 18
TypeScript (because types save lives)
Tailwind CSS (utility-first everything)
ShadCN/UI (beautiful components)
Augmented UI (my preferred framework)
```

## 🔥 Quick Start

npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 and enjoy
```

## 💭 Philosophy

*"Code is poetry written in logic."*

Every line here represents hours of problem-solving, late-night debugging sessions, and those magical moments when everything just clicks. I believe in writing code that's not just functional, but elegant, maintainable, and tells a story.

## 🎯 What's Next

- Adding more interactive demos
- Implementing real-time features
- Exploring new technologies
- Building things that matter

---

*Built with passion, powered by curiosity, and fueled by the endless pursuit of clean code.*
